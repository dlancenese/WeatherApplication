# WeatherApplication
First project bringing in data from an API. The GUI skills are still lacking, so displaying all the data from the API is something I haven't finished yet.
I did add a print statement though that actually shows the parsed JSON file so it will still display all the correct data and it is proof that it is working
Just does not show all that data on the actual GUI that I built.
The project uses my API key. To get your own you just have to follow the URL and make an account. Then change the API key and change the value in the URL.
The project gathers data from the name of the city that you search.
